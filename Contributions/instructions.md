### What is it for?

Sometimes, we are trying to download a mix of youtube, and we get errors due to youtube-dl can't read all the links, so with this improve, we can get every link first and then use youtube-dl to download one by one so we won't have more problems.

Here you can find steps:

###Step 1: 

Open you browser, go to Youtube and find a Youtube MIX.

###Step 2:

Hold "CRTL + SHIFT + i" and go to "CONSOLE" TAB.

###Step 3:

Copy the code you can find on "First Contribution" and paste it into the browser's console. A file named youtube_list.txt will be downloaded. This file contents every link of each song of the mix

###Step 4:

Use youtube-dl commands as always to download the videos.

###Step 5: 

Enjoy it!
